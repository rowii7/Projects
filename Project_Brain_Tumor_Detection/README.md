# üß† Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Scans

This project presents a deep learning-based system for binary classification of brain MRI images into **tumor** and **no tumor** categories. Leveraging **transfer learning** with **ResNet50**, the project aims to assist radiologists by automating the detection process, improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## üìå Project Overview

Brain tumor diagnosis is critical and often challenging. Manual MRI analysis is prone to human error and can be time-consuming. This project uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, specifically **ResNet50**, for the **binary classification** of brain MRI images:

- **Yes Tumor (1)**
- **No Tumor (0)**

Key techniques include:
- Dataset merging and balancing
- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning with ResNet50
- Performance evaluation using standard metrics

## üìÅ Dataset

Two public Kaggle datasets were used:

1. **Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection**  
2. **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset** (merged Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary into one "tumor" class)

After merging, the dataset was:
- Cleaned (duplicate & corrupted images removed)
- Resized to **224x224**
- Balanced: 3,500 images per class (7,000 total)

Split:
- **70% Training**
- **15% Validation**
- **15% Testing**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

- Image resizing and normalization
- Label encoding: `'yes' ‚Üí 1`, `'no' ‚Üí 0`
- Augmentation: rotation, zoom, shifting (for minority class)
- Undersampling: controlled downsampling of the majority class

## üß† Model Architecture

Built using **ResNet50** (pretrained on ImageNet), with modifications:

- Base model frozen (initially)
- Global average pooling
- Dense layer: 128 units, ReLU
- Output layer: 1 neuron, sigmoid activation

**Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
**Optimizer:** Adam  
**Epochs:** 10
