This repository contains a collection of machine learning models I have developed as part of my studies and personal projects in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Each project reflects different aspects of ML, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-world application.

Feel free to explore the folders to learn more about each model and the techniques used.
